These factors, combined with the growing trend of content creation and professional-level gaming, contribute to the sustained dominance of desktop GPUs in the market. <h2>Laptop</h2> <p>Laptop graphic cards have seen considerable growth in the United States market, especially as portable computing continues to improve in terms of performance and power efficiency. Traditionally, laptops were considered inferior to desktops when it came to graphic processing power, but advances in mobile GPUs have significantly bridged this gap. Laptops with dedicated graphic cards are increasingly popular among gamers, designers, and content creators who require high levels of graphical fidelity in a portable form factor. The integration of powerful GPUs in gaming laptops and workstations has allowed users to engage in professional-grade video editing, 3D rendering, and gaming experiences while on the go. Moreover, the advent of slim, lightweight laptops with high-performance GPUs is reshaping the industry. The continuous improvement in thermal management technologies and energy-efficient chipsets has facilitated the development of laptops capable of handling demanding applications, such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). The ability to run high-end games, advanced design software, and artificial intelligence (AI) models on laptops has driven the demand for mobile graphic cards, making them a prominent segment of the market. Additionally, with the increasing reliance on portable devices in both personal and professional spheres, the demand for laptops equipped with powerful GPUs is expected to rise further in the coming years. <h2>Others</h2> <p>The “Others” segment in the United States graphic cards market encompasses a diverse range of applications that go beyond the traditional desktop and laptop use cases. This category includes various specialized applications in fields such as digital signage, embedded systems, and industrial computing, where graphic cards are essential for tasks like visual display management and real-time image processing. For instance, in the realm of digital signage, GPUs are used to create and manage high-resolution advertisements and visual content across public spaces. Embedded systems, which power devices ranging from kiosks to smart televisions, also rely on graphic cards to provide efficient graphical processing in compact devices. The growth of “Others” as a market segment is also tied to the proliferation of IoT (Internet of Things) devices, where graphical capabilities are becoming increasingly important. For example, smart security systems and advanced monitoring equipment often require high-quality image processing, which is supported by graphic cards. Additionally, GPUs are crucial in specialized sectors such as automotive, healthcare (medical imaging), and robotics, where real-time data processing and visualization are required. As more industries adopt GPU-driven technologies for high-performance computing, the “Others” segment will likely experience significant growth, driven by both innovations in GPU design and the broadening scope of applications in non-traditional areas. <h2>Key Trends in the Market</h2> <p>One of the key trends driving the United States graphic cards market is the growing popularity of esports and high-performance gaming.
